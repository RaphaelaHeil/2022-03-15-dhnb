## Installing Anaconda from Scratch 

### Windows

1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda for Windows Installer with Python 3 (If you are not sure which version to choose, you probably want the 64-bit Graphical Installer Anaconda3-...-Windows-x86_64.exe). 
3. Install Python 3 by running the downloaded Anaconda Installer. You can use all of the default setting, _however_ please ensure to **check** the option `Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable`.



### MacOS
1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for macOS. If you have not used the Command Line before, we recommend the Graphical Installer. 
3. Install Python 3 by running the downloaded Anaconda Installer using all of the default settings for installation.

### Linux
1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for Linux. (Please note that the remainder of the steps require the use of the shell. If you are not comfortable doing the installation yourself, please get in touch with the workshop team.)
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the executable is downloaded (e.g. `cd ~/Downloads`)
4. Type
```
bash Anaconda3-
```
and then press the **Tab** key to autocomplete the full file name. The name of the file that you just downloaded should appear. 
5. Press **Enter** to start the setup process which runs via text-only prompts. To move through the text, press **Spacebar**. Type `yes` and press **Enter** to approve the license. Approve the default location for the files by pressing **Enter**. Finally, type `yes` and press **Enter** to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes Anaconda the default Python version).
6. Close the terminal window.

## Updating from Older Versions

If you already have Anaconda installed on your machine, you may want to update it, to make sure you have the latest version of Python and relevant packages. Resources for doing so can be found here: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/update-version/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/update-version/)


## Uninstall/Remove Anaconda

If you wish to remove Anaconda after the tutorial, please take a look at these resources: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/)
